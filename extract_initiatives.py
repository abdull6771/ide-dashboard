   INVESTMENT AMOUNTS:
   - If exact amount not stated, infer scale from initiative description:
     * "pilot", "trial", "proof of concept" → "Minor (estimated < RM 500K)"
     * "implementation", "deployment", "rollout" → "Moderate (estimated RM 500K - 5M)"
     * "major", "significant", "large-scale" → "Major (estimated RM 5M - 20M)"
     * "strategic", "transformation", "enterprise-wide" → "Strategic (estimated > RM 20M)"
   - Look for indirect clues: team size, scope, duration, technology complexity
   
   TIMELINE:

     * Strategic priorities mentioned in report
     * Industry trends and competitive pressures
     * Operational challenges being addressed
     * Growth or efficiency objectives
   - Use context: "Aligns with company's digital transformation strategy to [inferred goal]"
   
   IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
   - Infer from initiative description:
     * Mention of partners → "Partnership-based implementation"
     * Mention of phases → Extract and structure phases
     * Mention of teams → "Cross-functional team approach"
     * Default: "Phased implementation with pilot and scale-up stages"
   
   WORKFORCE IMPACT:
   - Always estimate based on initiative scale:
     * Digital training mentioned → "Upskilling program for affected staff"
     * Automation → "Workforce transition to higher-value tasks, estimated 10-15% productivity gain"
     * New technology → "Training programs for technology adoption, estimated 20-40 hours per employee"
   
   EXPECTED IMPACT:
   - NEVER leave as "Not mentioned" - infer from:
     * Initiative category and objectives
     * Similar initiatives in industry
     * Strategic goals mentioned in report
   - Structure: "Expected to [specific benefit] leading to [business outcome]"
   
   INNOVATION LEVEL:
   - Evaluate based on:
     * "Incremental": Improving existing processes, standard tech adoption
     * "Moderate": New capabilities, emerging tech, significant process changes
     * "Transformational": Disruptive tech, business model changes, industry-leading
   
   TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS:
   - If not explicitly mentioned: "To be determined" or "Likely major vendors in [technology area]"
   - Look for brand names anywhere in section (Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, AWS, etc.)

✅ Use contextual clues from entire report:
   - Budget discussions → estimate investment scales
   - Strategic priorities → business rationale
   - Operational metrics → baseline and targets
   - Industry benchmarks → expected improvements

✅ Provide specific, detailed responses even when inferring
✅ Use qualifiers when estimating: "estimated", "projected", "likely", "approximately"
✅ DO NOT fabricate: specific dollar amounts, exact dates, actual partner names, precise percentages
✅ DO estimate: ranges, scales, durations, qualitative impacts, strategic alignment
